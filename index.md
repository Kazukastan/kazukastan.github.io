### Kirna Gaming 

**Games, With Friends!**:

The club will take place at my house, located at 2010 Anderson Cove Lane.
Please text or email your available dates to the contacts at the bottom of the page. 
Once enough people have told me their available days, the next meeting will be decided.
This may lead to an erratic schedule, but this is only done in order to make sure that as many people as possible may attend.
